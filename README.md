Working Calculator in Python

Coder: Harshit Soni
Registration Number: 25BCE11030

Project Overview

This project is a fully functional calculator created using Python.
It performs essential arithmetic operations and is designed to help beginners understand how mathematical calculations are handled programmatically.
The calculator runs through the command-line interface and includes input handling and error-checking mechanisms.

Objective

The main objectives of this project are to:

Implement basic arithmetic operations

Learn how to handle user input and validate it

Practice using conditional statements in Python

Build a simple real-world application using fundamental programming concepts

Features

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

Modulus

Power calculation

Error handling for invalid inputs

Simple and clear user interaction

Project Structure

The project contains a Python file that performs all calculator operations and a README file that explains the project.

How It Works

The user enters the first number

The user selects an arithmetic operation

The user enters the second number

The program processes the input and performs the calculation

The result is displayed to the user

Concepts Used

Variables and data types

Arithmetic operators

Conditional statements

User input handling

Exception handling

Function structure in Python

How to Run

The project can be run using any Python 3.x environment.
You simply open the Python file and execute it using a Python interpreter.

Applications

Basic mathematical calculations

Learning Python fundamentals

Building understanding of program flow

Forming a base for more advanced calculators (GUI or scientific)

Future Improvements

Adding a graphical user interface

Adding scientific calculator features

Adding a history panel for previous calculations

Improving user experience and interaction
